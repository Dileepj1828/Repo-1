*Describe what the figure is showing.*

the figure decribes the different species of male and female along the x-axis and their bodymass along the y-axis respectively.


*What happened when you removed the outer parentheses from the code? Why?*

we get the compilation error with wrong syntax.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`?*

when i’m replacing ‘markcircle() with ’marksquare()’ the circle plot representation changes to square.


*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markPoint()`?*

when i'm replacing ‘markcircle() with ’ ‘markPoint()’ the circlot plot representation changes to hallow circles.

*What change do you need to make to swap the x and y axes on the scatterplot?*

The x and y axes on the scatterplot need to be changed, and that means we must swap their values. The values on the x and y axes can be switched using a single temporary variable.

*Insert the bar chart image here*

*Why do you think this chart is the result of this code change?*

The code we updated was vl.y(), which removes the chart's y-axis.fieldN("Origin"), leaving us with only the x-axis, which represents the count of records in the visualization.
